Soundex Class
=============

With the Soundex Class, you can fetch data from a field of a MySQL table, that sounds the same like any given word.

It supports English and German words.

The class uses PHP's soundex() function for English words, and the Cologne phonetic for German ones.

Please check the howto.php for more information.

Of course it is experimental, so I do not give any warranties.
